This project implements a HTTP-based endpoint for AWS SNS Subscriber. Read http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.html for undertanding the details.
This currently supports : Subscription Confirmation, Notification.

How it works:
1. Create a Topic in AWS SNS
2. Deploy this Web API project to a publicly exposed web server. For eg: this was deployed in an EC2 instance.
3. Create a subscriber , select HTTP as endpoint and provide following url:
	http://<servername>/<vd>/api/subscriber/handlemessage
4. When subscriber is created, AWS SNS will send a POST request for Subscriber Confirmation. When successful, the subcriber will be assigned a ARN
5. Publish to the topic.
6. AWS SNS will send a POST request for Notification.

Pending:
1. Unsubscribe Confirmation
2. Verifying authenticity of request
3. HTTPS
